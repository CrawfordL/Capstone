# Capstone
Project Name: Chatbot

Project Description
The Chatbot project is a web-based application developed using PHP and SQLite that provides AI-powered responses to user queries. The chatbot is integrated with Quen 3 AI to deliver conversational AI capabilities. The project focuses on user interaction, conversation history storage, and security features such as input validation and rate limiting.

Project Tasks

Task 1: Set up the development environment
Install and configure PHP, SQLite, and required dependencies
Set up a local server using php -S localhost:8000
Initialize Flask-based AI integration (python ai.py)

Task 2: Develop the chatbot interface
Create a simple UI with a text input field for user interaction
Implement real-time chat display functionality

Task 3: Integrate the AI Model
Connect the chatbot to Quen 3 AI
Ensure user messages are sent to the AI model and responses are displayed

Task 4: Implement conversation history
Use SQLite to store user conversations
Display past conversations in a separate history page

Task 5: Add security and error handling
Implement input validation to prevent malicious input
Add rate limiting to prevent spam or excessive API usage

Task 6: Improve UI and design
Apply styling using CSS for a modern chat interface
Ensure messages are displayed properly and formatted correctly

Task 7: Testing and debugging
Perform manual testing for functionality and security
Debug any errors related to API calls, database storage, or UI

Task 8: Deployment and documentation
Ensure the application runs smoothly on a local server
Document the setup, usage, and troubleshooting steps

Project Skills Learned
Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for chatbot UI
Backend Development: PHP for handling user authentication and API calls
Database Management: SQLite for storing conversation history
AI Integration: Using Quen 3 AI to handle user queries
Security Features: Input validation and rate limiting
Server Management: Running Flask and PHP servers simultaneously
Testing & Debugging: Identifying and fixing API/database issues

Languages & Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Frontend development
PHP – Backend logic and webpage handling
SQLite – Database for storing conversation history
Flask (Python) – AI integration and API handling
Quen 3 AI – AI model for chatbot responses

Development Process Used
Agile Methodology: The project was developed iteratively, adding new features and improvements each week based on testing and feedback.

Project Challenges & Improvements
What went well?
Successfully integrated Quen 3 AI with PHP and Flask
Implemented conversation history storage in SQLite
Added basic security measures like input validation and rate limiting
Styled the chatbot for a better user experience

Challenges faced:
Setting up SQLite database integration
Getting the AI model to work properly with PHP
Ensuring that messages were displayed correctly
If given more time, I would have:
Added a user registration system
Improved UI styling and animations
Enhanced security with better authentication methods

Notes
To run the chatbot locally:
Start the PHP server:
php -S localhost:8000
Start the Flask AI backend:
python ai.py

Python libraries: Flask, requests, flask_cors, sqlite3
PHP installed on the system
